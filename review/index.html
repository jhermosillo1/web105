    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>In the <strong> Gone </strong> series by <em> Michael Grant </em>
    all the adults disappear in the blink of an eye. All except for the young people.
Anyone over the age of 15, poof, gone. All of a sudden, there are
no phones, no internet, no televison. No way to get help. And there's 
also no way to find out what has happened. </p>
<p>With no adults around, hunger threatens. Bullies rule. A sinister creature lurks.
    Animals are mutating. Teens themselves are also changing, they are developing new
talents. Talents that are unimaginable, dangerous, deadly powers that get stronger as 
the days pass. </p>
<p>It's a terrying new world. Sides are being chosen, and fight, a war. Town people
    against the rich kids. The bullies against the weak. Powerful against the powerless.
    But their time runs out, on their 15th birthday, they disappear just like everyone else.

<p>The <strong>Gone</strong> series is personally my favorite series. It makes you feel 
like you are living in the book. One thing I like about this series is that it doesnt just give
you the perspective from one person, but from multiple characters. This way it shows you the
different point of views.</p>
<p>One of my favorite quotes from this book is "We didn't Make this World we're just the poor 
    fools who are living in it." This quote shows how desperate the kids living in this new world 
    that they call the "FAYS."
